"""Per-character user-activity tracker.

Combines the process-wide ``SystemSignalCollector`` with session-scoped
hooks (user/AI message timestamps, voice mode + RMS) and asks the
``ActivityStateMachine`` to emit a snapshot.

One ``UserActivityTracker`` exists per ``LLMSessionManager`` (so per
character). The collector singleton is shared. Tracker instances are
cheap — ~a few KB of buffers — so spinning one up for every active
character is fine.

Hook contract
-------------

Callers (mostly ``main_logic/core.py``) invoke these short, synchronous
methods at the points where signals occur:

  * ``on_user_message()``  — when the user submits text or finalises voice
  * ``on_ai_message()``    — when the AI's reply turn ends
  * ``on_voice_mode(active=True/False)``  — when entering / leaving voice
  * ``on_voice_rms()``     — when RMS / VAD detects user is speaking
  * ``on_screenshot()``    — placeholder for v2 (vision-described frames)

System signals (window, idle, CPU) are pulled at snapshot time from the
collector — there's no separate update path for those.

Snapshot consumer
-----------------

Only the proactive-chat code path calls ``get_snapshot()``. It runs on
the order of seconds (not milliseconds), so the small per-call cost of
running the state-machine classifier is irrelevant.
