"""User-activity tracker package.

Public surface:

  * ``UserActivityTracker`` — per-character orchestrator. Owned by
    ``LLMSessionManager``.
  * ``ActivitySnapshot`` — immutable result type returned by
    ``get_snapshot()``.
  * ``ActivityState`` / ``Propensity`` — string enums used both inside
    the snapshot and by the proactive-chat prompt builder.
  * ``get_system_signal_collector`` — process-wide singleton accessor;
    callers usually don't need this directly (tracker auto-uses it),
    but exposed so app shutdown code can ``stop()`` it.

Implementation modules (``state_machine``, ``system_signals``) are
internal — import from this top-level only.
