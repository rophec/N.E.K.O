# Where does N.E.K.O send conversations and memory?

N.E.K.O stores character memory locally by default, but relevant content can leave the device when you use a model provider, memory-processing task, free API route, cloud speech service, Steam Cloud, Workshop, online feed, browser feature, or remote Agent channel.

Last fact review: **2026-07-19**.

::: warning Technical data-flow notice
This page explains the current implementation and official distribution statements. It is not a substitute for a jurisdiction-specific privacy policy, provider agreement, or legal review.

## Data-flow overview

```text
User input
├─ local conversation and per-character memory storage
├─ selected conversation or realtime provider
├─ optional memory-processing provider
├─ free API forwarding path
├─ optional telemetry
├─ optional proactive screen context
├─ user-triggered Steam Cloud or Workshop operation
└─ online content, browser, speech, or Agent service
```

## What happens in each path

| Path | Data involved | Destination | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Character memory storage | Recent turns, facts, reflections, persona, journals, indexes | Local configured memory directory | Local storage does not mean all processing is local |
| Conversation provider | Current prompt, conversation context, attached input | Selected model provider | Provider terms, retention, region, and account plan apply |
| Memory maintenance | Relevant conversation or memory text | Configured summary/extraction/correction provider | Runs only for the applicable task, but can contain user content |
| Explicit memory recall | Selected recalled snippets | Active conversation provider as tool output | The full memory database is not automatically sent |
| Shipped free API path | Input needed for the free request | N.E.K.O forwarding service and service partner | Current Steam EULA distinguishes this from bring-your-own paid API use |
| Telemetry | Usage and operational metadata described below | N.E.K.O telemetry service | Can be disabled with environment variables |
| Proactive vision | Screen stream or screenshots needed by the enabled feature | Local pipeline and configured vision/model path | Privacy mode stops proactive viewing; manual screenshots are separate |
| Steam Cloud | Allowlisted character settings and memory files | Steam Auto Cloud | Snapshot is not a full memory-directory backup |
| Workshop publish | User-selected card, supported model files, preview, optional reference voice | Steam Workshop | Publication and asset licensing are user decisions |
| DEBUG diagnostics | Query or tool arguments in some debug paths | Local logs unless the user shares them | Do not assume every log is content-free |

## Free API and your own provider key

The current [Steam EULA](https://store.steampowered.com/eula/4099310_eula_0) describes two relevant paths:

- with a paid provider API, input is sent from the device to the selected provider;
- with the free API service, input can be forwarded through N.E.K.O servers to service partners.

The selected provider remains an independent data processor with its own terms. A provider entry existing in the configuration does not establish the same retention or privacy behavior across all providers.

## Local memory and remote processing

The memory system keeps separate per-character layers for recent context, facts, reflections, and persona, backed by a chronological local database. Several maintenance tasks may use an LLM:

- recent-history compression and review;
- fact extraction and correction;
- reflection synthesis and promotion;
- persona merge and contradiction handling;
- explicit recall returned to the active conversation model.

Optional embedding inference is local CPU ONNX, but that does not make the LLM-based maintenance tasks local. Read [Memory System](/architecture/memory-system) for the current runtime contract.

## Telemetry

The repository README states that telemetry is enabled by default and collects operational categories such as:

- model and call type;
- token, request, and error counts;
- application version, experiment information, locale, timezone, and distribution;
- a pseudonymous device identifier and, in applicable Steam environments, a Steam numeric ID.

It states that raw conversation text, voice, images, API keys, email addresses, and phone numbers are not telemetry payloads. The implementation and the README must remain synchronized.

## Screen and proactive-vision controls

Privacy mode stops proactive vision and releases its screen stream. It does not mean that a manual screenshot or a user-initiated screen-sharing action is technically impossible. First-run behavior can differ by distribution or region, so verify the current setting instead of assuming a universal default.

Agent and plugin capabilities have separate enablement and readiness controls. See [Agent System](/architecture/agent-system) and [Task HUD System](/architecture/task-hud-system).

## Steam Cloud is a partial character snapshot

Cloud Save uploads and downloads a character unit through Steam Auto Cloud. The allowlist includes common flat files such as recent memory, facts, persona, reflections, and `time_indexed.db`, but excludes current sharded archives, some metadata, recovery journals, and SQLite sidecars.

A download can replace local same-name character data and therefore uses confirmation, active-session handling, and a local operation backup. Read [Cloud Save API](/api/rest/cloudsave) before calling it a backup or migration solution.

## Controls available today

| Control | What it does | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| Choose a provider | Changes the service receiving the applicable request | That every other feature uses the same provider |
| Disable telemetry | Stops the project telemetry path | That third-party providers receive no requests |
| Enable privacy mode | Stops proactive screen viewing | That manual screenshots cannot be requested |
| Disable Agent channels | Prevents those channels from dispatching | That chat or memory providers are local |
| Avoid Cloud / Workshop | Avoids those optional transfer paths | That model APIs are offline |
| Delete a current character | Removes current runtime character memory paths | That every historical legacy directory or remote provider copy is removed |
