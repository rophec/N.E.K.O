"""GameAgentService — wires the WebSocket client to the LLM session.

Responsibilities split off the plugin facade so it stays testable:

1. Hold the cross-callback state (pending tool call, log/screenshot
   caches, task-finished signal).
2. Translate raw agent-server frames into push_message v2 payloads:
   * screenshots → image parts on the realtime stream
     (``ai_behavior="read"``)
   * task_finished → wakes the pending ``minecraft_task`` handler so it
     can return the result to the LLM
3. Run the autonomous "system prompt" loop that periodically nudges the
   LLM with the latest game state when there's nothing else for it to
   talk about.

The original integration in ``main_logic/core.py`` (commit ``bca0c5f3``,
later abandoned) baked all of this directly into the realtime client
class. This module keeps every game-agent concern inside the plugin so
adding/removing the feature is a pure plugin install / uninstall.

Async semantics
---------------
``minecraft_task`` is fundamentally async on the agent side: the LLM
calls the tool, we send the task to the agent server, and the result
arrives later as a separate ``task_finished`` frame. The SDK's
``@llm_tool`` contract is that the handler returns a value when done.
We bridge the two by having the handler block on an :class:`asyncio.Event`
that the WebSocket callback sets when the result comes in. ``timeout``
on the decorator caps the wait so a wedged agent server doesn't pin the
LLM forever.
